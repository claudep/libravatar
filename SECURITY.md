# Reporting security bugs

Here are some security-related information for Libravatar.org and the
Libravatar protocol.

## Bugs in the Libravatar.org service

There are two ways to report security bugs in the Libravatar service:

1. [File a bug on the tracker](https://bugs.launchpad.net/libravatar/+filebug) with a "Private Security" visibility.
2. Email Francois Marier at `security@libravatar.org`

## Bugs in the Libravatar protocol

For bugs in the Libravatar federated protocol itself, please email `security@libravatar.org`.

## Bugs in third-party libraries

If you find a bug in a [third-party library](https://wiki.libravatar.org/libraries/),
please email its author directly, but feel free to CC `security@libravatar.org`.

# Acknowledgment

If you email `security@libravatar.org`, we will do our best to acknowledge your
email within 48 hours. If you haven't heard from us, please try again or ping
us through [another channel](https://wiki.libravatar.org/talk_to_us/).

# Disclosure policy

It is of course up to you whether or not you publicize the security
vulnerability you have discovered, but we do ask that you please give us a
bit of time to deploy a fix before you discuss your findings publicly.
